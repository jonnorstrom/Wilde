      <h2>Motorcycle</h2>
      <p>This type of liability coverage protects you against the cost to repair or replace another person's property that's damaged as a result of an accident you cause on your motorcycle.

      <h2>Auto</h2>
      <p>Auto insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to mitigate costs associated with getting into an auto accident. Instead of paying out of pocket for auto accidents, people pay annual premiums to an auto insurance company; the company then pays all or most of the costs associated with an auto accident or other vehicle damage.</p>

      <h2>Home</h2>

      <h2>Renters</h2>
      <p>Renters insurance is an insurance policy that provides most of the benefits of homeowners insurance. Renters insurance does not include coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure. This provides liability insurance. The tenant's personal property is covered against named perils such as fire, theft, and vandalism. The owner of the building is responsible for insuring it but bears no responsibility for the tenant's belongings.</p>

        <br><br>1)Provides additional liability coverage above the limits of your homeowners, auto, and boat insurance policies. This protection is designed to kick in when the liability on these other policies has been exhausted.<br><br>
        2)Provides coverage for claims that may be excluded by other liability policies including: false arrest, libel, slander, and liability coverage on rental units you own.

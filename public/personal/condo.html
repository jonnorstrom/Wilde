    <h1>Types of Insurance:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" unchecked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Condo</h2>
        <p>Condo insurance covers the insured's personal property against named perils such as fire, theft, and vandalism.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Auto</h2>
        <p>Auto insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to mitigate costs associated with getting into an auto accident. Instead of paying out of pocket for auto accidents, people pay annual premiums to an auto insurance company; the company then pays all or most of the costs associated with an auto accident or other vehicle damage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Homeowners insurance is a form of property insurance designed to protect an individual's home against damages to the house itself, or to possessions in the home. Homeowners insurance also provides liability coverage against accidents in the home or on the property.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Renters</h2>
        <p>Renters insurance is an insurance policy that provides most of the benefits of homeowners insurance. Renters insurance does not include coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure. This provides liability insurance. The tenant's personal property is covered against named perils such as fire, theft, and vandalism. The owner of the building is responsible for insuring it but bears no responsibility for the tenant's belongings.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Landlord</h2>
        <p>Landlords insurance is an insurance policy that covers a property owner from financial losses connected with rental properties. The policy covers the building, with the option of insuring any contents that belong to the landlord that are inside.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Motorcycle</h2>
        <p>This type of liability coverage protects you against the cost to repair or replace another person's property that's damaged as a result of an accident you cause on your motorcycle. It's often paired with bodily injury liability insurance, which covers medical expenses caused to others in an accident.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>RV</h2>
        <p>RV insurance typically covers: damage to vehicle or property, theft, vandalism, injury to the insured or other people, personal liability, and/or accidents with uninsured or underinsured drivers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Classic Car</h2>
        <p>Your car may be considered classic if the motor vehicle is ten or more years old, and rare or of special historical interest because of exceptionally fine workmanship or limited production. Antique automobiles are also covered as such, a motor vehicle 25 or more years old.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Watercraft</h2>
        <p>Watercraft insurance, also known as boat and personal watercraft insurance, often includes towing and wreckage removal, as well as fuel spill indemnification. This type of insurance may be purchased for sailboats, house boats, and pontoon boats, as well as other watercraft up to a certain size and value.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <i></i>
        <h2>Umbrella</h2>
        <p>Umbrella insurance is extra liability insurance. It is designed to help protect you from major claims        and lawsuits and as a result it helps protect your assets and your future. It does this in two ways:
          <br><br>1)Provides additional liability coverage above the limits of your homeowners, auto, and boat insurance policies. This protection is designed to kick in when the liability on these other policies has been exhausted.<br><br>
          2)Provides coverage for claims that may be excluded by other liability policies including: false arrest, libel, slander, and liability coverage on rental units you own.
